# GoldBadgeChallenges

This repository contains three challenges for the Gold Badge Console Application Challenges.

The challenges that were done are:

1.Komodo Cafe

2.Komodo Claims Department

3.Komodo Outings

When looking at the files, you can see the file for both Komodo Claims Department and Komodo Outings.

The Komodo Cafe is for some reason located under the file named GoldBadge_ConsoleApp_Challenges.

Commiting things to github is not my strong suit...

The repository tests for all three challenges are under the file called Testing.

I do not know what all the other files are on this repository, but I am not touching them in fear of breaking everything.
